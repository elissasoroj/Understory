Access to meaningful research opportunities at the post-secondary and undergraduate level for many students is challenging, and represents a significant __ that prevents students from entering scientific fields. Leveraging the accessibility of simulation- and coding- based projects can help alleviate this gap in equity, allowing students to develop impactful research projects in a self-directed manner, even if they are resource-limited. 

Understory is a case-study in this framework for creating accessible, open-source resources in conjunction with regular research activities conducted by all members of a lab. The availability of free and sophisticated tools for developing online resources leaves little excuse for scientists to avoid utilizing them. Developing such a resource, in addition to __ and creating opportunities for lab members, also increases transparency and serves as a access-point for a public audience. 

Understory is a __ based on `shadie`, a python wrapper developed for SLiM. Using __ as a guide, Understory provides:

1. Background Information: in the form of a text that covers topics relevant to the project
2. Resources: for learning more about the topic (open-access where possible)
3. Research Guide: a tutorial-style guide for students to help them develop a research project utilizing `shadie`. Appropriate for advanced high school and undergraduate students
4. Research Hub: an online home where outcomes of research projects utilizing shadie can be accessed. This hub is maintained on the `shadie` documentation site, but Understory provides specific instructions encouraging students to contribute to this resource. This allows them to engage with the community, publish their work informally, and for scientists in the field to benefit from what they find.
